# The yap shorthand works via argv[0] dispatch in the binary itself.
# To test it without make install, we create a symlink named "yap"
# pointing at the built binary — same as what the install wrapper does,
# but without the exec indirection. The binary sees argv[0]="yap" and
# routes to the speak subcommand.
#
# NOTE: This tests the argv[0] dispatch only. The install-wrapper topology
# (exec -a yap through bin/yap → libexec/yapper for Bundle.main resolution)
# is tested by release.sh's runtime smoke test, which constructs the full
# bin/libexec layout.
