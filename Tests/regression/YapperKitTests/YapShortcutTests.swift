// ABOUTME: Regression tests for the yap shorthand command (issue #14).
// ABOUTME: Invokes bin/yap via YapperProcessHarness to exercise the real install wrapper and argv[0] dispatch.

/// Issue #14: yap is a shorthand for `yapper speak`. Implementation is a bash
/// wrapper at `bin/yap` that uses `exec -a yap` to set argv[0]="yap" while
/// executing the real `libexec/yapper` binary. The binary's own argv[0]
/// dispatch (in Sources/yapper/Yapper.swift) notices argv[0]=="yap" and
/// rewrites the argument list to prepend "speak" before handing off to
/// ArgumentParser.
///
/// ## Why these tests are RT, not OT
///
/// The original tests for #14 were OT-14.1 through OT-14.8 in
/// Tests/one_off/HomebrewFormulaTests.swift — static grep checks on
/// Formula/yapper.rb, Yapper.swift, Makefile, and README.md. Those tests
/// passed while v0.8.4 shipped a broken install topology, because none of
/// them invoked the binary. Per the post-mortem, replaced with runtime
/// tests that invoke bin/yap via the real wrapper.
///
/// Moved from OT to RT because these protect an ongoing behavioural
/// invariant (yap routes to speak) rather than a per-release artefact.
/// Per TESTING.md §"Never renumber", OT-14.1–14.8 IDs are preserved as
/// 🚫 removed on the #14 AC table; new RT-14.x IDs are allocated for
/// these replacements.
