  def install
    # Prebuilt Developer-ID signed binary and its Swift resource bundles go into
    # libexec. bin/yapper and bin/yap are wrapper scripts that `exec` the real
    # libexec/yapper binary — NOT symlinks. On modern macOS, Bundle.main.bundleURL
    # (which MLX uses to locate default.metallib and other resource bundles) is
    # derived from the *invocation* path, not from the symlink target. A symlink
    # at bin/yapper would make Bundle.main look for the .bundle resources in bin/
    # instead of libexec/, and synthesis would fail at runtime with
    # "Failed to load the default metallib".
    #
    # `exec` ensures the parent shell is replaced so signals and exit codes
    # propagate cleanly. `exec -a yap` on the yap wrapper sets argv[0]="yap" so
    # the binary's own argv[0] dispatch (in Sources/yapper/Yapper.swift) routes
    # to the speak subcommand automatically — making `yap "text"` behave as
    # `yapper speak "text"`.

  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      Yapper ships as a prebuilt Apple Silicon binary, Developer ID signed
      with hardened runtime and notarised by Apple.

      Model weights and English voices are downloaded automatically at install
      time from the tigger04/yapper models-v1 release (Apache 2.0, redistributed
      from hexgrad/Kokoro-82M). They live in:
        #{share}/yapper/models
        #{share}/yapper/voices

      Try it:
        yapper speak "Hello, world"
        yapper voices
    EOS
  end

  test do
    assert_match "0.8.8", shell_output("#{bin}/yapper --version")
